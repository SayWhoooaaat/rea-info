    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Rank Everything Always! By using this app, you agree to these terms and conditions. This app is provided as is, without any guarantees or warranties of any kind.</p>

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Rank Everything Always is a tier list app that runs entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. There are no ads, no analytics, no login, and no servers involved. All data remains on your device, and you have complete control over it.</p>

    <p>You have the option to add cover photos to your items using your device's camera, by picking a photo from your device, or by selecting an image via a webview. These images are only used locally in the app and are not uploaded or shared with any servers. The app does not access any data without your explicit action.</p>

    <p>There is also a donate button in the settings, which is entirely optional. It is only there for users who wish to support the development of the app, but there are no incentives or requirements to use it. The app is completely free to use.</p>

    <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>The "Rank Everything Always" app requests camera permission solely to allow users to take photos that can be used as cover images for their items within the app. These images are used only locally within the app and are not collected, stored, shared, or uploaded to any external servers. You have full control over any photos taken using the app, and they are never accessible outside of your device unless you explicitly share them yourself.</p>

    <h2>Screenshot Functionality</h2>
    <p>The "Rank Everything Always" app includes a feature that allows users to take screenshots of the webview to use as cover images for their items. These screenshots are saved locally on the device and are used solely within the app.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that any content captured via the screenshot feature may be subject to copyright or other intellectual property rights. It is the user's responsibility to ensure they have the right to use any content they capture.
